# hello-world
My first repository

Michael here! I'm finally getting my feet wet in programming. I have a background in mechanical engineering and I want to make the shift into web or software development. I've started programming lesson in java and so far I find it interesting. I've been told that because its a hard language to learn, mastering that will allow me to learn other languages easier. I want to get into html/css/javascript, and I also have an interest in learning php, node, and ruby. I have a looooong way to go, but I'm excited to begin.
